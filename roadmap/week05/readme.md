Ever wonder what it’s actually like to work in the field? Now’s your chance to get a behind-the-scenes look at the day to day of an office. Ask current employees questions, see the office environment, and get a personalized tour. We’ve set up an organization to walk you through their space.

Come with 3 questions for our presenters. This will include a tour of the space and time for a brief presentation from the organization and Q+A. 

Don’t forget to connect with all speakers on LinkedIn and thank them for their time!
